# Trigger.h - Interactive README

Welcome to `Trigger.h`! This lightweight C++ class enables seamless trigger mechanisms with customizable callbacks. 

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Include `Trigger.h` in Your Project

```cpp
#include "Trigger.h"
```
_First things first! Make sure you include the Trigger.h file in your C++ project. This file contains all the magic for making triggers work._


### Step 2: Instantiate a Trigger Object

```cpp
Trigger myTrigger;
```
_Think of a trigger like a button you want to press. To use it, you need to create a trigger object. Let's call it myTrigger._
### Step 3: Set a Callback Function

```cpp
myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
    std::cout << "Trigger activated!" << std::endl;
});
```
_Now, decide what should happen when you press the button (activate the trigger). This is where the setCallback function comes in. You tell the trigger what to do when it's activated._
### Step 4: Activate the Trigger

```cpp
myTrigger.activate();
```
_Now that you've set up your trigger, it's time to press the button and see what happens! Use the activate method to trigger the action you defined in the callback._

## Features

### Callback Registration

Users can register custom callbacks with the `Trigger` class using the `setCallback` method, providing the flexibility to define specific actions.


```cpp
myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
    // Your custom action here
});
```
_Think of this as giving the trigger a job to do. You can tell it, "When you're activated, do this specific task." It's like programming the trigger to have a special skill._
### Activation Mechanism

The `activate` method triggers the registered callback(s), allowing seamless execution of associated functionality.

```cpp
myTrigger.activate();
```
This is the actual button press! When you call myTrigger.activate();, it's like pressing the button you set up earlier. The trigger then performs the task you assigned to it.
### Simple Integration

Designed for ease of integration into existing C++ projects, providing a straightforward interface for setting up triggers and associated actions.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "Trigger.h"

int main() {
    Trigger myTrigger;

    myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
        std::cout << "Trigger activated!" << std::endl;
    });

    myTrigger.activate();

    return 0;
}
```
