# Trigger.h - Interactive README

Welcome to `Trigger.h`! This lightweight C++ class enables seamless trigger mechanisms with customizable callbacks. 

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Include `Trigger.h` in Your Project

```cpp
#include "Trigger.h"
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a Trigger Object

```cpp
Trigger myTrigger;
```

### Step 3: Set a Callback Function

```cpp
myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
    std::cout << "Trigger activated!" << std::endl;
});
```

### Step 4: Activate the Trigger

```cpp
myTrigger.activate();
```

## Features

### Callback Registration

Users can register custom callbacks with the `Trigger` class using the `setCallback` method, providing the flexibility to define specific actions.

```cpp
myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
    // Your custom action here
});
```

### Activation Mechanism

The `activate` method triggers the registered callback(s), allowing seamless execution of associated functionality.

```cpp
myTrigger.activate();
```

### Simple Integration

Designed for ease of integration into existing C++ projects, providing a straightforward interface for setting up triggers and associated actions.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "Trigger.h"

int main() {
    Trigger myTrigger;

    myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
        std::cout << "Trigger activated!" << std::endl;
    });

    myTrigger.activate();

    return 0;
}
```
