# Trigger.h - README

Welcome to `Trigger.h`! This lightweight C++ class enables seamless trigger mechanisms with customizable callbacks. 

## How to Use this

Users can add the `trigger.h` header file to their C++ project from the GitHub repository by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the GitHub repository containing the `trigger.h` file to your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

   Replace `https://github.com/username/repository.git` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Copy the Header File:**
   Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the repository directory. Locate the `trigger.h` file and copy it to the include directory of your C++ project.

   ```bash
   cp trigger.h /path/to/your/project/include/
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/project/include/` with the actual path to the include directory of your C++ project.

3. **Include in Your Code:**
   In your C++ source code file where you want to use `trigger.h`, include it using the following directive:

   ```cpp
   #include "trigger.h"
   ```

   Ensure that the relative path matches the location where you copied the `trigger.h` file.

4. **Build Your Project:**
   Build your C++ project with the updated code, including the `trigger.h` file. The specific build process depends on the build system you are using (e.g., Makefile, CMake).

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Include `Trigger.h` in Your Project

```cpp
#include "Trigger.h"
```
_First things first! Make sure you include the Trigger.h file in your C++ project. This file contains all the magic for making triggers work._


### Step 2: Instantiate a Trigger Object

```cpp
Trigger myTrigger;
```
_Think of a trigger like a button you want to press. To use it, you need to create a trigger object. Let's call it myTrigger._
### Step 3: Set a Callback Function

```cpp
myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
    std::cout << "Trigger activated!" << std::endl;
});
```
_Now, decide what should happen when you press the button (activate the trigger). This is where the setCallback function comes in. You tell the trigger what to do when it's activated._
### Step 4: Activate the Trigger

```cpp
myTrigger.activate();
```
_Now that you've set up your trigger, it's time to press the button and see what happens! Use the activate method to trigger the action you defined in the callback._

## Standards / __cplusplus macro

some common values for the `__cplusplus` macro representing different C++ standards:

to check your c++ standard 

```cpp
xcrun clang -x c++ -E -dM - < /dev/null | grep -F __cplusplus
```

- `199711L`: C++98 (the original C++ standard from 1998)  
- `201103L`: C++11 (introduced many new features, ratified in 2011)
- `201402L`: C++14 (a revision of C++11 with additional features, ratified in 2014)
- `201703L`: C++17 (introduced more features and improvements, ratified in 2017)
- `202002L`: C++20 (added numerous features and enhancements, ratified in 2020)

⚠️ **Warning: `trigger.h` is Not Supported in `C++98 (199711L)` :**

The file `trigger.h` may not be supported when compiling with the C++98 standard (original C++ standard from 1998). This standard lacks certain features introduced in later versions of C++, and using `trigger.h` with C++98 may lead to compilation errors or undefined behavior.

It is recommended to compile your code with a more recent C++ standard, such as C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20, depending on the features and language enhancements your code relies on.

To compile your code with a specific C++ standard, use the `-std` flag followed by the desired standard version. For example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 your_file.cpp -o your_executable
```

## Features

### Callback Registration

Users can register custom callbacks with the `Trigger` class using the `setCallback` method, providing the flexibility to define specific actions.


```cpp
myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
    // Your custom action here
});
```
_Think of this as giving the trigger a job to do. You can tell it, "When you're activated, do this specific task." It's like programming the trigger to have a special skill._
### Activation Mechanism

The `activate` method triggers the registered callback(s), allowing seamless execution of associated functionality.

```cpp
myTrigger.activate();
```
This is the actual button press! When you call myTrigger.activate();, it's like pressing the button you set up earlier. The trigger then performs the task you assigned to it.
### Simple Integration

Designed for ease of integration into existing C++ projects, providing a straightforward interface for setting up triggers and associated actions.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "Trigger.h"

int main() {
    Trigger myTrigger;

    myTrigger.setCallback([]() {
        std::cout << "Trigger activated!" << std::endl;
    });

    myTrigger.activate();

    return 0;
}
```

## FAQ

---

### 1. What is the significance of the `__cplusplus` macro in C++?

The `__cplusplus` macro in C++ is a predefined macro that indicates the version of the C++ standard being used during compilation. It provides a way for developers to conditionally include or exclude code based on the C++ standard version. For example:

```cpp
#if __cplusplus >= 201703L
    // Code specific to C++17 and later
#else
    // Code for earlier C++ standards
#endif
```

### 2. How can I check the default C++ standard used by my compiler?

You can check the default C++ standard used by your compiler with the following command:

```bash
xcrun clang -x c++ -E -dM - < /dev/null | grep -F __cplusplus
```

This command will print the value of `__cplusplus`, indicating the default C++ standard.

### 3. Why is `199711L` associated with C++98?

The value `199711L` for `__cplusplus` corresponds to the C++98 standard, which was the original C++ standard ratified in 1998. The trailing `L` signifies a long integer literal.

### 4. How can I compile C++ code with a specific standard?

To compile C++ code with a specific standard, use the `-std` flag followed by the desired standard version. For example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 your_file.cpp -o your_executable
```

Replace `c++14` with the version you want to use (e.g., `c++11`, `c++17`, `c++20`).

### 5. Why might `trigger.h` not be supported in C++98?

`trigger.h` may not be supported in C++98 due to the lack of certain features introduced in later C++ standards. Using `trigger.h` with C++98 could lead to compilation errors or undefined behavior. It's recommended to compile code with a more recent C++ standard to benefit from additional language features and improvements.

#### 6. **Can I customize the callbacks when using the `trigger.h` header file?**
   Yes, the `trigger.h` file supports customization. You can set your own callback functions using the provided `setCallback` method, tailoring the behavior according to your project's requirements.

#### 7. **Is the `trigger.h` header file compatible with different C++ standards?**
   The `trigger.h` file is designed to be compatible with various C++ standards. However, it's essential to ensure that your project's C++ standard is compatible with the features used in the `trigger.h` implementation.

#### 8. **How can I contribute to the `trigger.h` project?**
   Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Feel free to reach out to the creator, Vishesh Yadav, for discussions on potential improvements or collaborations.
